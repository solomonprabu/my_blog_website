                and start of the 20th century saw education reaching the
                unreached spaces. One such defining moment was the establishment

                The Bharathiar University was established at Coimbatore by the
                Government of Tamilnadu in February 1982 under the Bharathiar
                University Act, 1981 (Act 1 of 1982). The erstwhile Postgraduate

                Bharathiar University, which was functioning at Coimbatore
                before 1982. University Grants Commission (UGC) recognized
                Bharathiar University in 1985 for grants.
